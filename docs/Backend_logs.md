    headers: { 'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}` }
  });
  const students = await response.json();
  return students;
};

// Example: Create appointment for student
const createAppointment = async (userId, appointmentData) => {
  const token = localStorage.getItem('adminToken');
  const response = await fetch(`http://localhost:5001/api/admin/appointments/users/${userId}`, {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}`,
      'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    },
    body: JSON.stringify(appointmentData)
  });
  return response.json();
};
```

## Medical Staff Implementation - Completed - June 12, 2025 ✅

### Summary
Completed medical staff appointment access functionality with proper role-based filtering and assignment validation.

### Implementation Details

#### Medical Staff Appointment Access
- **View Assigned Appointments**: Medical staff can only see appointments where they are assigned via `medical_staff_id`
- **Create Appointments**: Medical staff can create appointments and assign themselves
- **Update Appointments**: Medical staff can update status, dateScheduled, and symptoms for assigned appointments
- **Assignment Validation**: All operations check if medical staff is assigned to the appointment

#### New AppointmentService Methods
- `getAppointmentsByMedicalStaff(medicalStaffUserId)` - Get appointments assigned to medical staff
- `createAppointmentByMedicalStaff(medicalStaffUserId, symptoms, priorityLevel, studentUserId)` - Create appointment with medical staff assignment
- `isMedicalStaffAssigned(appointmentId, medicalStaffUserId)` - Validate medical staff assignment

#### Route Separation Analysis
**No route conflicts found** - Clean separation maintained:
- **Student Routes**: `/api/appointments/*` - Own appointments only
- **Admin Routes**: `/api/admin/appointments/*` - All appointments with admin privileges  
- **Medical Staff**: Uses `/api/appointments/*` with assignment-based filtering

#### Integration Status
- ✅ Appointment Controller fully integrated with real services
- ✅ Medical Staff appointment access implemented
- ✅ Student privilege API format maintained (`{symptoms, priorityLevel}`)
- ✅ Admin service provides elevated privileges for all appointments
- ✅ Role-based middleware properly routes requests

### API Format Consistency
All roles now use consistent appointment API:
```javascript
// Student & Medical Staff
POST /api/appointments
Body: { symptoms: string, priorityLevel: "low|medium|high" }

// Admin (different endpoint)
POST /api/admin/appointments/users/:userId  
Body: { symptoms: string, priorityLevel: "low|medium|high", dateScheduled?: string }
```
